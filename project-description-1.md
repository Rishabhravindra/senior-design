## Background Description
As more and more teenagers and young adults are becoming addicted to their screens, there is an increasing need of applications that take people outside their homes and have them socialize with one another. Our application, ScavengAR, is a solution to this.

ScavengAR is a scavenger hunt application that enables people to explore new places around them, and encourages collaboration and healthy competition. With a story-based mode and interactive Augmented Reality features, it gets you out and about, and has something for everyone.

## Problem Statement
There are very few apps that allow us to truly engage with our environment in a way that promotes health and fitness.

## Inadequacy of Current Solutions
There are two types of applications that attempt to solve this problem:
1. **Fitness Tracking Applications:** These apps are generally boring and simply provide an interface for tracking your progress. They may include incentives but fail to engage for long.

2. **Location-Based Games:** Apps such as PokemonGo and Ingress are excellent implementations that solve this problem, but get repetitive after a while and are unable to branch out to all audiences, as not everyone is familiar with the details of the Pokemon world. A more general scavenger hunt application would reach an audience with a larger age range, and can be personalized according to location.

## Background Skills and Interest
**Background Skills:** We have experience in full stack web development, machine learning, natural language processing, and mobile app development.

**Interest:** We are interested in adding to our skillset and are looking forward to dabbling in augmented reality and diving into mobile app development.

## Approach, Goals and Expectations
**Primary Goals**
1. Develop a mobile application with an engaging scavenger hunt experience.
2. Implement a login system and a database to enable storage of user and location-specific information.
3. Create AR characters and objects that show up at specific locations in the form of hints and rewards.
4. Incorporate a fitness goal and tracking system to promote an active life.
5. Provide a way for users to collaborate and compete with one another.
6. Write AI/ML algorithms to auto-generate rewards and game tokens.

**Stretch Goals**
1. Provide a mechanism for users to create their own scavenger hunts.
2. Implement themed scavenger hunts (eg: Harry Potter, Halloween, Easter, etc.)
3. Create limited-time competitions.
